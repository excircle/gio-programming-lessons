# Introduction to the Terminal & Python Programming Language

This lesson is dedicated to learning about computer terminals and the Python programming language.

# Philosophy: Where Does Control Begin?

Every lesson will have a philosophical concept that embodies principles pertaining to what we wish to learn.

For today's lesson we must reflect on the genesis of control.

#### Where does control reside within the following items???

Fill in the blanks of this [JSON Document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

```json
[
    {
        "A Bike": "",
        "A Car": "",
        "Someone Driving a Car": ""
    },
    {
